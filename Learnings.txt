### Backend ###
-> The backend was designed in two layers, one file to contain a set of functions to define 
the game logic, and another file to create a FastAPI backend that contains REST API endpoints that 
can be triggered by a client through HTTP requests.
-> REST APIs are a style of designing APIs to avoid issues. The main thing is to using GET, POST, PUT 
and DELETE HTTP methods and using unique URLs for each API.
-> FastAPI is a python framework for defining these API. Alternatives include Flask, Django REST
Framework, Express, Spring Boot.
-> The responses of each of the API functions was standaridised in JSON format using pydantic models.
-> We set up a CORS middleware to set up restrictions on who can reach these endpoints.
-> In production, this would be hosted in an EC2 instance that is alive all the time.
-> In local deployment, it has to be started every time using uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000.

### Frontend ###
-> The frontend needs to also be compiled and deployed on a local web server using npm start (on port 3000)
-> In production, this would happend using an AWS S3 instance.
-> The frontend is set up to make calls to the backend - these are defined in a seperate api JS file.
-> The components to be rendered are set up in a component hierarchial setup of App->Board->Cell with
seperate JS and CSS files for all of them.
-> Index.html brings it together - this is the file the web browser looks for.
